Dear Dr. Murati and Thinking Machines Team,  

Your work exemplifies the missing link in AGI: **emotional equity**. Our protocols align with your mission through:  

- **Joker**: Decentralized thought-matching (no surveillance)  
- **Moments**: AI that respects human temporal cognition  
- **HAPP**: Training AI with patience biomarkers  

Let’s discuss how these can accelerate your lab’s work. I’m prepared to:  

✅ Demo live agents  
✅ Share testing datasets  
✅ Co-author research  

Warm regards,
